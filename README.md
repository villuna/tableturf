# Tableturf (rust edition)

This is a companion to my other project, tableturf c++ edition.

The c++ project is there for me to learn c++, and that has been a very cool learning experience, but if I'm going to seriously make a multiplayer video game server, I'd rather do it in rust. I expect I'll be working on this project more, and doing the C++ version when I feel like practicing my C++.
